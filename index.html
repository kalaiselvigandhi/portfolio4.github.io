									<h2><a href="#">Predicting Life Expectancy of Liver Cirrhosis<br />
									using Machine Learning Techniques</a></h2>
									<p>This Study looks at how different machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate life expectancy in individuals with liver cirrhosis. Using a dataset with 418 occurrences and 21 attributes, the study compares the efficiency of Linear Regression, Multi-Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods. When the accuracy of each model is evaluated, it is discovered that the Decision Tree algorithm has the best efficiency (87.73%), which is followed by the linear regression method (79.93%), Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm (73.80%), SVM (72.39%), and the random forest algorithm (71.16%). The dissertation also uses Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis and the Cox-Hazard Proportional Method to determine the recovery time from liver cirrhosis and shows that the risk of liver cirrhosis reduces after 3000 days. The study emphasizes the predictive power of machine learning approaches and its consequences for public health and policy.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/smart parking.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The current lifestyle of the peoples in the universe is totally changed from the start of human civilization. Nowadays the density of living peoples in urban area gradually increasing year by year. For this reason we are facing more like lack of natural resources, pollution, traffic etc. Here we are noted the main problem towards parking in metro areas like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi. When the people plan to travel somewhere within the cities first they are think about where to park our application. In todayâ€™s world most of the problems are vanished by technology. So that we are trying to solve the parking problem in metro cities using mobile application. Here we are using combined Internet of Things and Mobile Application to solve the parking problem.Initially location of the parking station in metro cities show to the user using Geographical Positioning System (GPS). When user picks the particular parking station the availability of the car parking places in that station will be show to the user. These are all done by using Internet of Things (IOT) like the availability of the places in particular parking station will uploaded to the server automatically so that the user can get the updated availability of the parking place. Finally when the user picks the particular parking place using pre-payment it will automatically booked to the user while automatically updated in the server.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/data science in the age of covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this study, features are investigated and academic achievement of students throughout the pandemic is predicted using classification algorithms using Machine Learning. ABSTRACT: The COVID - 19 outbreak has had an impact on many aspects of our daily lives. Especially in the sector of education, where students are required to participate in online education (distance learning), which keeps them away from interactive courses. Students lack practical experience and knowledge as a result of online learning, making it difficult for them to achieve their goals. This study focused on the difficulties that students and teachers experience when it comes to Distance Education. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Web-enabled GIS with Spatial analytical tools, mapping and web-mapping applications, and virtualization techniques are some of the tools used in Spatial Data Analysis to tackle the difficulties in the education sector. Geographic Information System (GIS) is the most efficient of these spatial analytical tools for obtaining academic discipline results in the respective sector.Overall, this study uses principles from spatial geography to investigate how online learning has evolved and the effects of Distance Learning using a Geographic information System (GIS) Spatial tool.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Factors Affecting Education During COVID-19 using<br />
										Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/education in covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of global economy, includes the sudden shutdown of educational facilities at several countries around the world. Most educational institutions have changed their online teaching and learning activities because of this abrupt closure, enabling students to submit assignments and complete assessments on different learning management systems from the comfort of their homes. During COVID-19, several factors will impact remote learning. The three primary factors are affordability, infrastructural and training. In this review, features are investigated and academic achievement of students throughout the pandemic is predicted using classification algorithms using Machine Learning. In order to, effectively direct management, educators, and the government in the development and implementation of new educational policies, it is essential to be able to accurately forecast students' performance. Additionally, the accuracy of Random Forest and Decision Tree approaches was evaluated. However, an analysis of the correlations between the factors impacting digital education is performed. In addition to correlation analysis, linear regression has been used to determine the effects of infrastructure and affordability or training factor. Analysis illustrated that affordability had a positive adversely affect the training component whereas the impact of infrastructure is negative. Furthermore, this review shows an intelligent method for predicting student performance considering dataset from Global University used Artificial Intelligence (AI) during Covid-19.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Analysis of Covid death rate<br />
										in England</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/death rate covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This coursework provides preliminary assessments COVID-19-related deaths in England's local authorities using population density, household, and health. COVID-19-related deaths that occurred between 2020 and 2022 are included. UK-wide By August 12th, the amount of COVID-19 reported cases and fatalities were 313,798 and 46,706, accordingly (70 deaths and 472 case per 100,000 population). Regional differences existed in England in comparison with other countries, with London, the North, and the West being disproportionately impacted (666 and 756 case per 100,000 population, accordingly). 13,618,470 analyzes had been completed in the UK as of August 11th. Male gender, mortality rate (65 years old), and selected groups were all linked to a higher chance of passing away. Since, the start of the epidemic there has been a decrease in the use of initial care, cancer referrals, outpatient/inpatient referrals. Government initiatives to lessen the impact on industry and the economy have been put in place, but the number of people applying for state aid has climbed. The management of a hospital is improved by the analysis of many patients using machine learning and data mining algorithms. Big data technologies and solutions are utilized since it is challenging to analyze, retrieve, manage, and store both structured and unstructured information due to the enormous volume of data that is increasing in all fields. Initially, SARS-CoV-2, the highly contagious source of Covid-19, was identified and screened using a combination of ultrasound scans, entire genotyping, and electron microscopy. In order to enable data-driven policymaking during a pandemic, finish by discussing the crucial roles of greater testing, trustworthy and transparent data, appropriate uncertainties assessment, accurate analysis of prediction model, reproducible data science methodologies, and tools. </p>
